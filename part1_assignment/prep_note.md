# Items per min on one yellow belt
There's no way of knowing it in demo mode. The way that belt statistics is measured is using a circuit network, which is not there in game demo. Throughput of yellow belt is though 900 items/min (15 per sec).

# Iron plates per min for 120 green circuits/min
Since the recipe of green circuit involve 1 iron plate per green circuit, thus 120 iron plates per min for the green circuit are needed.

# Crude -> product ratio from basic oil
There's no crude oil patch in demo. One can know this like me, by playing through all tutorials hoping that oil and its processing could be introduced in last tutorial, but it's never added in tutorials, and the demo version only allows playing the tutorial.

# One bottleneck and fix
For production of item that require lots of intermediate products (e.g.green scienc pack), any point of production could become bottleneck. Like for researching, I had to scale in number the green pack production units, because contructing new tech required research first, and research almost always required green and red science packs, where the green one is the harder one to produce, because each green production require lots of intermediate products and time.
So, green pack is the bottleneck in researching and progressing and increasing the producers is the only solution.

# One simplification that made your layout cleaner
Arranging production units linearly symmetrically (if possible) helped. Also it mostly kept machines at uniform distance ensuring smooth and consistent production from all machines. Underground belts also reduced a lot of mess.
